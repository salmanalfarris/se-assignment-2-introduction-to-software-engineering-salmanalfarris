Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is the systematic application of engineering principle,tools and method to the development of high quality software system.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
is a descipline that deals with design,development and maintenance of software system,it differs from traditional programming in that software engineering is a broader field that encompasses the entire software development process including requirement gathering,design,coding,testing while traditional programming refers to act of writting code to solve a specific problem without necessarly following a systematic process.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirement-gathering and documenting user needsand system requirement.
Design-creating high level and detail design of the software artitechture and user interface.
Implementation-writting code and building the software according to the design specification.
Testing-conducting various test to ensure the software meet the quality standard and functional requirement.
Development-releasing the software to the users or customer.
Maintenance-providing ongoing support,updates to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile uses short iteration to deliver value rapidly,allowing teams to adjust plans overtime and thus used to achieve shorter time frame while waterfall method is designed for longterm project with predetermined timelines.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
is the process of defining,documenting and maintaining requirement.it involves activities like elicitation,analysis,specification and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders needs thus;
-helps in avoiding misinformations.
-helps developers effectively plan,design and implement software that meets client and users expectations.
-serve as a basis for creating test cases and scenarios to run effective test.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller,independent modules such as function,classes or component
-it facilitate easier management and understanding of complex system by breaking them down into digestable parts.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Unit testing that is testing individual component or modules of software.
-Integration testing that is testing interaction between different component of sub systems.
-System testing that is testing the entire software as a whole.
-Acceptance testing that is testing the software against user requirement to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing is crucial because it identifies potential issues before they reach end users,reducing the likelihood of software failure and the associated financial and repetitional risk.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
-It keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
-Help developers move faster and allow software teams to preserve efficienty and agility as the team scale to include more developers.
-examples include GIT which is free,reliable and open source.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
-oversee the software development team.
-delegating work effectively.
-monitoring progress and tracking roadblocks.
-managing the deployment deliverables.
Challenges are;
-lack of accountability.
-poor planning and unrealistic deadlines.
-misalignment between goals and business objectives.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
is the process of changing,modifying and updating software to keep up with customers need.
Types include;
-Preventive maintenance which include regular and periodic schedule.
-Corrective maintenance which occurs when an issue is noticed.
-Predetermined maintenance which follows a factory schedule.
-Condition based maintenance which occurs when a situation or condition indicates maintenance is needed.
-predictive maintenance which is a data driven and impacted by present parameters.
-Reactive maintenance which occurs when a total breakdown or failure appears.
Its essential because it maintains software functionality,make upgrades to the coding and ensure any repairs need to the software are completed.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
-compliance,confidentiality,data integrity and conflict of interest.
-By ensuring compliance with the various standards ISO,creating inclusive and accessible software that does not descriminate against individual based on race,age or disability.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
